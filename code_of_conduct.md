###Note
This is the **groupwork** of developing a project using _Java_. Repository is on the _GitHub_ and collaborate within a team.  Each members take responsibility for the specific tasks. **Project backlog** is also prepared on _GitHub_. Other platforms likes, _Docker_ is used to run MongoDB in it. Travis CI is also used to check the status of **builds**.

####Developed Platforms
 1. [intelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
 2. [GitHub](https://github.com/)
 3. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
 4. [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)

####Workflow
* create a repository on GitHub
* build the project with JAR and Maven
* setup the project with Dockerfile
* setup the project with Travis CI and create builds
* make sure those builds work efficiently with JAR and Maven on Travis CI
* make sure all the branches of the Git workflow are correct
* create release on GitHub

####Issues
* unmatching JDK version can fail over the project setup
* sometimes docker fails to start and need to restart docker
* Running builds on Travis CI fails due to the lack of compiler
* queuing takes much times on some devices

####Rules and regulations
* should take full responsibility on assigned tasks
* finish up tasks in time
* cooperate  and negotiate within a team
* respect and value on team members
* be fair and listen to their POV idea in decision-making
